# Popular twitter friends locations

purely personal project that gets the locations of people I follow on Twitter + people I have in my
lists, then compiles the locations they live in, sorts them and displays them.

Helps me keep up to date with where the cool people live nowadays.

Can be customizable in the future if you provide your own API keys.
